 Changed output to file
 Changed festival to read file not strings
 broke out code to different scripts

 you will need to install festival and gcalcli for this to work. They are part of the repos in ubuntu.  You can change the voice on festival with a little searching on the web.  If you don't have the calc program installed you may need to install that as well.
 
 sudo apt-get install festival
 sudo apt-get install gcalcli
 sudo apt-get install apcalc
